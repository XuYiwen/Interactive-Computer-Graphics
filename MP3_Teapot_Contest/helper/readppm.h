/* readPPM: read a PPM raw (type P6) file.  The PPM file has a header
 * that should look something like:
 *
 *    P6
 *    # comment
 *    width height max_value
 *    rgbrgbrgb...
 *
 * where "P6" is the magic cookie which identifies the file type and
 * should be the only characters on the first line followed by a
 * carriage return.  Any line starting with a # mark will be treated
 * as a comment and discarded.   After the magic cookie, three integer
 * values are expected: width, height of the image and the maximum
 * value for a pixel (max_value must be < 256 for PPM raw files).  The
 * data section consists of width*height rgb triplets (one byte each)
 * in binary format (i.e., such as that written with fwrite() or
 * equivalent).
 *
 * The rgb data is returned as an array of unsigned chars (packed
 * rgb).  The malloc()'d memory should be free()'d by the caller.  If
 * an error occurs, an error message is sent to stderr and NULL is
 * returned.
 *
 * filename   - name of the .ppm file.
 * width      - will contain the width of the image on return.
 * height     - will contain the height of the image on return.
 *
